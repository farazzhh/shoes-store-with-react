# shoes-store-with-react

 This is Online-Shopping Project that created by React (styled-components).
 In this Project. You can sign up and login with your email or google acounts.
 
 I used ReactHooks( useContext , useRef , useEffect , useState ) and I create some custom hooks for fetch data, and LocalStorage to hold Cart Items localy, and Auth0 SDK used for loging. 
 
 By the way you can sort products by Name and price.

After loging , u can see user icon in navbar and your username in Homepage Header.

There are products data and navbar menu and submenu items in Data.json file. You can add or remove menu's item by editing "navBarMenu" in Data.json file. ðŸ¤Ÿ

Excuse me for UI/UX problems. I'm not UI/UX designer and this project is to show my abilities in coding.
